    "text": "The Muthurajawela Wetland in Sri Lanka is a vital ecological resource that provides many ecosystem services that are essenstial for the wellbeing of the people, the environment, and the Colombo city itself . However, this fragile ecosystem is under the threat of encroachment by human activities and commercial developments. Recently there were two petitions, filed by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith and the Environmental Justice Center, requesting the court to order the demarcation of the wetland boundaries.\nOn Jan 27, 2023, the Court of Appeal gave the government of Sri Lanka three months to complete the demarcation of the Muthurajawela Wetland. This decision is a significant step towards protecting the wetland and preventing further damage to its delicate ecosystem.\nAs an avid supporter of environmental conservation, I was interested in studying the changes in vegetation cover in Muthurajawela over the years. I used satellite imagery to create a Google Earth Engine app that demonstrates the change in vegetation through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a commonly used parameter for identifying vegetation in multispectral images.\nThrough my analysis, I found that there has been a significant change in vegetation cover in the area due to urban sprawl and commercial developments. These changes have led to the loss of critical habitats for several species of animals and plants, resulting in a negative impact on the overall biodiversity of the wetland.\nAccess the Google Earth Engine App here\nHere is a timelapse showing the landcover change in the area. Generated with annual composite Landsat images, visualised using SWIR1, NIR, and Red bands."

    "text": "SMS Emden is a ship of the legends. She brought the great war to the Indian Ocean and harassed British ships and ports. She single-handedly raided ports of Madras and Penang and capture nearly twenty vessels. Emden’s campaign terrorized the British colonies in the region and the name Emden entered the vernacular in Sinhala, Tamil and Malayalam languages as a word for someone who is crafty and manipulative.\n\nInspired by the above map from A History of Sea Power by William Oliver Stevens and Allan F. Westcott, I made this map of the cruise of the Emden."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sight of sunrise over Samanala Kanda makes for a glorious morning. On a good day there are many places in western region where you can see this. There was one place on my commute to school where, if my usual bus came on time, I could see the siluette of the Sri Pada before the rising sun. I always tried to catch a glimpse through the crowd.\nIt was an interesting problem for the spatial analyst in me to map all the places that can see a Samanala Kanda sunrise. Here’s my attempt to do that using the viewshed analysis tools in QGIS.\nBoth GRASS and GDAL packages in QGIS have viewshed analysis tools. There are also more feature-rich plugins like visibility analysis.\n\n\nFor visibility analysis, we need a digital elevation model. I used the JAXA ALOS 3D DEM which is a 30 m global DEM ## Approach\nViewshed analysis finds the area visible from a certain location. How can we use that to solve the problem of finding the places that can see a Sri Pada sunrise ? I consider a Sri Pada sunrise is conditional up on the following two requirements. 1. There should be a direct line-of-sight between the observer and the mountain 2. Relative to the observer, the sun should rise behind the mountain\nAreas that satisfy the first requirement can be found using viewshed analysis. However, if we did the analysis for the topmost point, results will be exaggerated because it will include any point that can see even just a tip of the mountain. So it will include places from where Samanala Kanda is hidden behind other landmasses bar a tiny tip. So for good measure, I run the viewshed analysis from a point on the western face of the mountain, about 200 m below the top.\nNow for the second requirement, we need to consider the direction of sunrise. Direction of sunrise changes through out the year. While it is not very apparent when you live near the equator, the sun path moves north in the north hemispheric summer and south in the winter. Extreme of this movement happens on the solstice, usually June 21 and December 21. So what we simply need to do is find the directions of the sunrise seen from Sri Pada for those two days. Triangle formed between these two lines and to the west of the mountain is the areas where such a sunrise can be seen.\n\nFinally the areas that satisfy both requirements can be found by intersecting the two results. Here is an embedded map of the results where you can zoom in and see where you can see a magnificent sunrise over Sri Pada. Looks like there are many good spots around Colombo to catch glorious view.\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %&gt;%\n  addTiles() %&gt;%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng=81.5, lat=6.8, popup=\"LK Random\")"
