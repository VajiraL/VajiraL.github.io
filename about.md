### About me

I am an environnmental engineer who is passionate about issues of water, climate change and urban sustainability. Currently I am enrolled in the double master's programme between the University of Tokyo and the United Nations University - Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS).

I graduated from the University of Tokyo, earning my Master's degree in Urban Environmental Engineering. I counducted research on planning sustainable sanitation using spatial analysis and data-driven modeling. I then continued my studies at the United Nations University, where I am pursuing a Master of Science in Sustainability. Here, I have been researching the issue of global freshwater salinization.

Before moving to Japan in 2020, I had the privilege of working in the water and sanitation sector in Sri Lanka for three years, in both the private and public sectors. I was fortunate to be a part of some exciting engineering projects and was responsible for designing water distribution systems, sewer networks, and treatment systems.
