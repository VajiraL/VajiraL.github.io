SMS Emden is a ship of the legends. She brought the great war to the Indian Ocean and harassed British ships and ports. She single-handedly raided ports of Madras and Penang and capture nearly twenty vessels. Emden's campaign terrorized the British colonies in the region and the name *Emden* entered the vernacular in Sinhala, Tamil and Malayalam languages as a word for someone who is crafty and manipulative.

Inspired by this map[^1], I made this map of the cruise of the Emden.
