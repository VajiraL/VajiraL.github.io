SMS Emden is a ship of the legends. She brought the great war to the Indian Ocean and harassed British ships and ports. She single-handedly raided ports of Madras and Penang and capture nearly twenty vessels. Emden's campaign terrorized the British colonies in the region and the name *Emden* entered the vernacular in Sinhala, Tamil and Malayalam languages as a word for someone who is crafty and manipulative.

Inspired by the above map from [*A History of Sea Power*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24797 "Project Gutenberg") by William Oliver Stevens and Allan F. Westcott, I made this map of the cruise of the Emden.
